        <h3>The Problem Nexus Solves</h3>
        <h4>University life can be overwhelming. From managing coursework and deadlines to finding relevant study materials, students often face a constant struggle to stay organized 
            and on top of their responsibilities. It can be difficult to navigate the sea of resources available, and often, the support students need is scattered across multiple 
            platforms, making it harder to focus on what's important.
            <br><br>
            In addition, many students face uncertainty when it comes to planning their future careers. Limited guidance, lack of clear pathways, and difficulty accessing relevant job 
            opportunities can leave students feeling lost or unsure of their next steps.
            <br><br>
            At Nexus, we understand these challenges. That's why we've created a platform that brings everything students need into one place, helping them not only succeed academically 
            but also confidently plan for their future.
